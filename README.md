# thermal_calf_analysis
Effect of camera angle on measurement of surface temperature in live calves.

An analysis I prepared together with Dr. Marco Ram√≠rez at the University of Bristol in 2019 during a PhD internship, under the supervision of Dr. Mike Mendl.

I haven't (and cannot) include the data that these exploratory analyses are based on, however the file 'Cow_data_analysis.html' shows an example of what was achieved.
